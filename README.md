# Hello!üëã 
Welcome to my design and development showcase. This repository features a collection of UX design projects and web development work.
## Who am I
I'm Claudia, a Psychologist and UX Designer with skills in front-end web development. I am fascinated by how people think and what captures their attention. Psychology and informatics are my two main passions.
## üìÅ UX Design projects
### 1. Kids Wear 
An app designed for parents to easily buy and sell their children's clothing. Users can upload products by adding photos and necessary details. They can also browse and purchase items listed by other users.

\- **Tools used:** Figma, Canva <br>
\- **Methodologies:** 
- ***User Research***: he research provided deep insights into users' thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Based on the interview findings, I developed user personas and began brainstorming potential solutions. The two main objectives were to design an app that facilitates the buying and selling of used clothes while ensuring reliability and security.
- ***Wireframing and Prototyping***: I began designing solutions with paper and digital wireframes, and then created a prototype by adding interactivity. 
- ***Usability Testing***: the usability test revealed both the strengths and areas for improvement in the design. By incorporating user feedback, I refined the design, resulting in the final version of the product.

### 2. Plant Care
An app designed to diagnose houseplant problems and enhance their care. Users can take a photo of their plants and receive an accurate analysis of their condition. The app also enables users to search for plants they own or are interested in and learn about their care requirements.
